### Solana Price Parser

### Description
This project implements a parser that extracts Solana price data for the last 5 years from a data source and formats it into a structured view.

### Technical description
The parser receives JSON data from a web request to the API, parses it using grammar rules, and outputs the results as a structured table.

### Applying
The parser can be used for various purposes. Here are some of them:

-Solana's historical price data can be used to build machine learning models that predict future prices.
-Data can be presented in the form of interactive graphs showing price changes over different periods.

-Investors can use the data to generate reports on Solana's historical volatility and stability to help assess risk and potential return.
-The parser can be part of a comparison tool with other cryptocurrencies, helping investors choose the best investment options.
